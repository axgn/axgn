## Hi there 👋
![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=axgn&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)
- 🔭 I am a college student and a programmer.
- 🌱 I am currently learning deep learning.
- ❤️ I like programming, math and anything about computer.
- 😸 Welcome to communicate with me about 
  programming and deep learning.
- 🎯 My goal is to become a programmer who constantly surpasses myself.
      The current goal is to gain an in-depth understanding of some of the content at the 
      intersection of deep learning and image processing, that is, object detection, image 
      classification, target point detection, image segmentation, etc., and then gradually expand 
      to more content of deep learning and image processing. On the hardware, you need to learn 
      some interface frameworks and libraries for STM32 and ESP32.
